# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page

![Design preview for the Notifications page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

This is a portfolio project intended to test and showcase my skills as a front-end developer.

The source of this project is the website [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) which has challenges that help to improve our coding ability by building realistic projects.

For this project, it was necessary to use knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The challenge

The challenge is to create this notifications page and make it as close as possible to the given design in the [challenge page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC).

The requirements were: 

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Steps to Solution

The first step was to build the HTML file, separating each content into different blocks according to the provided design, using divs, paragraphs and spans.

After that, I took care of handling the CSS, checking the necessary style, defining the display of the elements, between grid and flex, so that they fit the design, taking into account the mobile-first approach.

This part of the project took the most time and involved the most detail.

With the styling of the elements, it was possible to focus on the behaviors according to the status of each one on the page (hover/focus).

Finally, the "Mark all as read" button, which removed style features from unread notifications. The jQuery library was used to do this functionality in JavaScript.

## Final result

The project is available at [this site](https://euphonious-otter-fefe50.netlify.app/). 

## Other Considerations

In this project, items such as directing links to other pages were not considered, nor triggers that made a notification receive the unread style and nor other things like that.
